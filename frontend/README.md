# [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [SB Admin](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/)


## Hi

This is my template in progress 
* Use the blank.HTML
* This uses bootstrap.css dashboard.css 
*Github does not let you upload packages, you need to install bower and npm yourself, or add it to the JSON file with this

"scripts": {
    "postinstall": "bower install"
  }


## There is a way  to install the packages automatically..working on it.
